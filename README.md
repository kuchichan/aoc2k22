## Advent of code with Scala 3

My solutions to advent of code 2022 - written in scala. I have made few assumptions in regards to the subject:

1. I use only scala and std lib
2. I try to keep my solutions in some functional / declarative regime
3. I am quite new to Scala, so the only person I compete with is myself :)
